I <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2010/03/02/keep-your-font-stacks-from-falling-over/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.sitepoint.com']);">blogged about testing font stacks earlier this week at SitePoint</a>, and pointed out a <a href="http://github.com/leeky/Font-Stack-Tester" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://github.com']);">very early-days project on GitHub</a> that seemed to be a first stab at developing a tool to simplify this kind of testing. Today I received an email from a reader, who apparently registered <a href="http://fontstacktester.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://fontstacktester.com']);" target="_blank">http://fontstacktester.com</a> and set up a web-based interface for doing just that in the intervening time. The tool is an adaptation of the script I had found on GitHub, except that you can just plug your website address into a box and you&#8217;ll be transported there, except with an overlay at the top that lets you switch off every font on your site individually to see if it breaks anything.

Here&#8217;s what it looks like running against this site:

Kudos to Chris for getting this thing up and running so quickly!
