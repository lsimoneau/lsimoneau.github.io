A great program all-round, *Ideas*, from CBC Radio, recently ran a two part round-table discussion on secularism in modern democracies that was just fantastic. A reasoned, in-depth, and principled discussion that steered clear of all the usual empty rhetoric on the topic. If you&#8217;ve got two hours of listening time at any point in the next few weeks, this is most definitely how I&#8217;d recommend you spend them.
