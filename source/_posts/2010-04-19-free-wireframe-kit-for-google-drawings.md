I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://gomockingbird.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://gomockingbird.com']);">Mockingbird</a> for creating quick mockups and wireframes. It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s online, and it does just about everything you want it to do.

That said, a bit of choice never hurt anyone, so it&#8217;s interesting to see that Google Drawings, the recent addition to the Google Docs family, can be used quite effectively as a wireframing tool.

<a href="http://mortenjust.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://mortenjust.com']);">Morten Just</a> wrote a <a href="http://mortenjust.com/2010/04/19/a-wireframe-kit-for-google-drawings/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://mortenjust.com']);">blog post</a> describing how he uses it for that purpose, but even more awesomely he&#8217;s shared a <a href="http://docs.google.com/drawings/edit?id=1PplF62IplwQ4SaabsR9P8HAw7mhilR1MTe71QMMr8iA&hl=en_GB" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://docs.google.com']);">drawing</a> with an extensive selection of shapes, stencils, and widgets sitting in the margin ready for use. With the help of this &#8220;wireframe kit,&#8221; Google Drawings really does stack up quite well against dedicated wireframing tools.

Just open the <a href="http://docs.google.com/drawings/edit?id=1PplF62IplwQ4SaabsR9P8HAw7mhilR1MTe71QMMr8iA&hl=en_GB" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://docs.google.com']);">document</a>, select File -> Make a copy, and you&#8217;re off to the races with a fantastic toolkit containing text input boxes, icons, check boxes, flowchart boxes, tabs, buttons, you name it.

Huge props to Morten for sharing this toolkit with the public.
