Last week the winners of the <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.webbyawards.com']);">2010 Webby awards</a> were announced. Jennifer Farley, one of the staff bloggers at SitePoint (where I work), recently <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2010/05/09/webby-award-winners-design/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.sitepoint.com']);">posted a breakdown</a> of five of the winners in design-related categories, along with her impressions of the sites in question. I think that&#8217;s a great idea, so I&#8217;m going to write my own version of that post, examining the same five winning sites.

**Best Homepage/Welcome page**

This category was won by <a href="http://malecopywriter.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://malecopywriter.com']);">Male Copywriter</a>. Here&#8217;s what that site looks like:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-60" title="copywriter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/copywriter1.png" alt="" />

I like the understated aesthetic and the use of black to convey authority.

**Best Structure/Navigation**

The winner in this category was <a href="http://www.hboimagine.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.hboimagine.com']);">HBO/Imagine</a>. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of that site:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-61" title="hbo" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/hbo1.png" alt="" />

Again, a simple, clean design that really speaks to the modern web audience. I love it.

**Best Use Of Animation/Motion Graphics**

The winner in this category is <a href="http://thepopshoppe.com/">The Pop Shoppe</a>. A very interesting design, shown here:

**Best Use Of Photography**

This category was won by <a href="http://thinkingspace.economist.com/">The Economist: Thinking Space</a>, with a stark design that really lets the photos speak for themselves:

**The Best Visual Design â€“ Aesthetic**

Finally, this coveted category went to <a href="http://www.nike.com/jumpman23/historyofflight/">Nike&#8217;s Jordan: History of Flight</a> site:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65" title="jordan" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/jordan1.png" alt="" width="540" height="300" />

Again, a minimalist style makes this website a clear winner.

**Conclusion**

I think the Webby awards have done a fantastic job highlighting the best of web design in 2010, across the full range of available technologies and adhering to the open principles that give the Web its true strength.
