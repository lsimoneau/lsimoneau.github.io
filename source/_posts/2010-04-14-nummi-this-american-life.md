Episode 403 of This American Life has a fascinating story about the US auto industry and how GM missed a golden opportunity to correct its course and save itself.

There&#8217;s a lot of interesting business theory in there, but even if that&#8217;s not your thing it&#8217;s great to have a window into this aspect of the history of the 20th and early 21st century.

Highly recommended.
