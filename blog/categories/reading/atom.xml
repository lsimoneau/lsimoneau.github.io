    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d start posting quarterly breakdowns of the books I&#8217;ve been reading, partly just to share stuff I&#8217;ve been enjoying, but mostly to shame myself into reading more my holding myself publicly accountable.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the first edition. Since the start of the year, I&#8217;ve finished four books. Pretty weak, I admit, but I&#8217;ve also had a child, so that&#8217;s my excuse:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Glasshouse-ebook/dp/B00486U2U0/ref=tmm_kin_title_0" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);"><strong><em>Glasshouse</em>, by Charles Stross.</strong></a> Possibly my new all-time favourite science fiction novel. Filled to bursting with ideas, it manages to create a plausible post-scarcity, post-&#8221;singularity&#8221; universe and a hugely compelling story at the same time. Can&#8217;t recommend it highly enough.</p>

<p><strong><em>How Much Is Enough? Money And The Good Life</em>, by Robert and Edward Sidelsky.</strong> A philosophical examination of modern Western society&#8217;s organisation, questioning how little of the gains in economic productivity of the last 50 years have gone towards improving average standards of living, framed in terms of &#8220;the good life&#8221;. The book was often overly academic in tone, but it drew on some interesting research and raised some (I think) very pertinent questions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Carbon Zero: Imagining Cities that can Save the Planet</em>, by Alex Steffen</strong>. A short book, available <a href="http://grist.org/carbon-zero/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://grist.org']);">for free online in full</a>, examining the role that urbanism can (and must) play in staving off the worst of the climate crisis. Steffen&#8217;s argument is compelling: converting the entire automobile fleet to hybrid or electric vehicles would take decades even if every car sold today were such a model, and likewise replacing the entire power generation grid with renewables is an enormous undertaking. But with the coming boom in urban development across the world, there&#8217;s real potential to make drastic reductions in carbon emissions with innovations in walkable urbanism, transport, and building technology.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Last Policeman</em>, by Ben Winters</strong>. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Policeman-Novel-ebook/dp/B0076Q1GW2/ref=tmm_kin_title_0" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);">Currently for sale for $2.99 on the Kindle store</a>.) A fun noir detective story, with the clever twist that it&#8217;s set in a world where a giant asteroid is months away from colliding with Earth and ending civilization as we know it. It took me a while to get into this one, as the noir tropes and first person narration felt a bit over the top, though in retrospect it&#8217;s clear that was the intent. All in all, it was a captivating mystery, and I&#8217;ve pre-ordered the next book in the trilogy, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Countdown-City-Last-Policeman-ebook/dp/B00B6OV90E/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1365421093&#038;sr=1-1&#038;keywords=ben+winters" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);">due to be released in July</a>.</p>
