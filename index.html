  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago a coworker of mine ordered a glass of beer in a pub while waiting for some pizzas to bring back to the office. After taking a big gulp, he immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, and knew something was wrong. It turned out that the pub had recently cleaned the beer tap lines with a potent cleaning fluid, and it hadn&rsquo;t all been flushed out. The result was that my friend spent a night in the hospital, and was unable to eat anything for over a day due to the swelling and pain in his throat. It&rsquo;s still not totally clear what his path to recovery will be like.</p>

<p>When I told the story to another friend, his reaction was &ldquo;Wow. It&rsquo;s almost like, as a barman, what&rsquo;s the worst mistake I&rsquo;m empowered to make?&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s true. Quite literally, there&rsquo;s not a thing you can do in the execution of a bartender&rsquo;s job that is worse than serving a customer highly caustic cleaning fluid in their drink.</p>

<p>And that got me thinking. What&rsquo;s the worst mistake <em>I&rsquo;m</em> empowered to make? Take the site down? Nope, pretty easy to have it back up in a few minutes, little harm done. Commit a bug to production? It would have to be a whopper. Really, the worst thing I think I&rsquo;m empowered to do is lose data. If I break something such that, even if we recover, we&rsquo;ve lost some user data, that&rsquo;s deadly. I can&rsquo;t think of any other single misstep that would be more damaging to the company.</p>

<p>As soon as I came up with that answer, I realized I actually spend quite a lot of time thinking about it. Ever since the first time I shelled in to a production server, and not infrequently since, this little voice at the back of my head asks: <em>Are you about to hose any data?</em> Every time I&rsquo;m running complex migrations, or implement a new feature that alters data in a major why, it&rsquo;s always there: <em>Don&rsquo;t do the wost thing you could possibly do.</em></p>

<p>Let me be clear: avoiding catastrophic fuckups isn&rsquo;t what I consider the hallmark of a great software developer, or a great anything for that matter. To be <em>great</em>, you need to succeed greatly, not simply avoid failure. But coming back to the example of the pub: this was a <em>really good</em> pub. Fantastic selection of craft beers, best pizzas in the area by a wide margin, and a very welcoming atmosphere. But I still won&rsquo;t be going back there, because, well, obviously: they poisonned a friend of mine.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s probably worth spending a little bit of time, every once in awhile, asking yourself what the worst possible mistake you&rsquo;re empowered to make is. And putting in place whatever safeguards seem reasonable to stop yourself from making it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought I&#8217;d start posting quarterly breakdowns of the books I&#8217;ve been reading, partly just to share stuff I&#8217;ve been enjoying, but mostly to shame myself into reading more my holding myself publicly accountable.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the first edition. Since the start of the year, I&#8217;ve finished four books. Pretty weak, I admit, but I&#8217;ve also had a child, so that&#8217;s my excuse:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Glasshouse-ebook/dp/B00486U2U0/ref=tmm_kin_title_0" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);"><strong><em>Glasshouse</em>, by Charles Stross.</strong></a> Possibly my new all-time favourite science fiction novel. Filled to bursting with ideas, it manages to create a plausible post-scarcity, post-&#8221;singularity&#8221; universe and a hugely compelling story at the same time. Can&#8217;t recommend it highly enough.</p>

<p><strong><em>How Much Is Enough? Money And The Good Life</em>, by Robert and Edward Sidelsky.</strong> A philosophical examination of modern Western society&#8217;s organisation, questioning how little of the gains in economic productivity of the last 50 years have gone towards improving average standards of living, framed in terms of &#8220;the good life&#8221;. The book was often overly academic in tone, but it drew on some interesting research and raised some (I think) very pertinent questions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Carbon Zero: Imagining Cities that can Save the Planet</em>, by Alex Steffen</strong>. A short book, available <a href="http://grist.org/carbon-zero/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://grist.org']);">for free online in full</a>, examining the role that urbanism can (and must) play in staving off the worst of the climate crisis. Steffen&#8217;s argument is compelling: converting the entire automobile fleet to hybrid or electric vehicles would take decades even if every car sold today were such a model, and likewise replacing the entire power generation grid with renewables is an enormous undertaking. But with the coming boom in urban development across the world, there&#8217;s real potential to make drastic reductions in carbon emissions with innovations in walkable urbanism, transport, and building technology.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Last Policeman</em>, by Ben Winters</strong>. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Policeman-Novel-ebook/dp/B0076Q1GW2/ref=tmm_kin_title_0" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);">Currently for sale for $2.99 on the Kindle store</a>.) A fun noir detective story, with the clever twist that it&#8217;s set in a world where a giant asteroid is months away from colliding with Earth and ending civilization as we know it. It took me a while to get into this one, as the noir tropes and first person narration felt a bit over the top, though in retrospect it&#8217;s clear that was the intent. All in all, it was a captivating mystery, and I&#8217;ve pre-ordered the next book in the trilogy, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Countdown-City-Last-Policeman-ebook/dp/B00B6OV90E/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1365421093&#038;sr=1-1&#038;keywords=ben+winters" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);">due to be released in July</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><code>PG::Error: ERROR:  permission denied: "RI_ConstraintTrigger_50931" is a system trigger</code></p>

<p>Just ran into this issue and had a hard time locating a solution, so just throwing it up here so others might be able to find it faster.</p>

<p>You might see this error message if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#8217;re using PostgreSQL with Rails</li>
<li>You&#8217;re using foreign key constraints</li>
<li>You&#8217;re using <a href="https://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://github.com']);">database_cleaner</a> to tear down your test databases</li>
</ul>


<p>The problem is this: Postgres sets up foreign key constraints as &#8220;system triggers,&#8221; which can only be removed by a superuser. When database_cleaner tries to empty out your database between test runs, it tries to remove these keys, which causes the failure.</p>

<p>Currently there isn&#8217;t a &#8220;real&#8221; fix for this, but Sergey Potapov has bundled together the required hacks into a gem called <a href="https://github.com/greyblake/rails3_pg_deferred_constraints" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://github.com']);">rails3_pg_deferred_constraints</a>. Pop it into your test group and you should be good to go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When everyone else&#8217;s git commits start showing up as &#8220;in the future,&#8221; you know something&#8217;s wrong.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s probably that your VM, having been suspended while your host OS was sleeping, has lost track of what time it is. You <em>could</em> <code>/etc/init.d/networking restart</code> every time you start work in the morning, but that&#8217;s a drag, and you&#8217;re likely to forget.</p>

<p>Instead, you want to use the NTP daemon to keep your clock in sync. By default, however, NTP will attempt to gradually and incrementally bring your clock back into sync, and will balk at large differences in time (like the 14 hours since you last opened your laptop). Fortunately, there&#8217;s a config setting for that.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s do this thing:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ntp
</code></pre>

<p>Then replace your <code>/etc/ntp.conf</code> file with the following:</p>

<pre><code>tinker panic 0

restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict default kod nomodify notrap

server 0.au.pool.ntp.org
server 1.au.pool.ntp.org
server 2.au.pool.ntp.org
server 3.au.pool.ntp.org

driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift
</code></pre>

<p>Replace those <code>server</code> lines with NTP servers of your choosing.</p>

<p>The important line there is <code>tinker panic 0</code>, which is what tells NTP not to freak out if the difference in time between the local clock and the server is larger than it would normally be comfortable with. This line <strong>needs</strong> to come <strong>before</strong> all other config directives.</p>

<p>With that config in place, fire off a quick</p>

<pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart
</code></pre>

<p>and you&#8217;re in business. Next time you bring your VM back up from a deep slumber, hit <code>date</code> and you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A great program all-round, <em>Ideas</em>, from CBC Radio, recently ran a two part round-table discussion on secularism in modern democracies that was just fantastic. A reasoned, in-depth, and principled discussion that steered clear of all the usual empty rhetoric on the topic. If you&#8217;ve got two hours of listening time at any point in the next few weeks, this is most definitely how I&#8217;d recommend you spend them:</p>
